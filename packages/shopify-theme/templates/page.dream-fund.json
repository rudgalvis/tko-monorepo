We’d love to raise our knitters’ salaries way beyond just living wage but, with our overheads, that’s currently not possible. Our Knitters Dream fund helps to bring these dreams to life bit by bit. With each purchase, you can choose to donate directly towards a dream of a woman who made your knit. That extra donation goes towards hiring a nutritionist, buying those beautiful apartment curtains or paying for dental implants. Or whatever else they’ve been been daydreaming about paying for.</p>",

She always believed that getting a driver’s license would be a complete game changer.</p><p>“I feel bad about constantly asking neighbors”, Marina explained to us. “They all have their routes and day-to-day lives. I actually tried driving a few times. My husband was super patient while teaching me. Sure it was terrifying, but I loved it. I’d love to be independent! Just imagine, whenever I need I could just hop into a car with my kids and go!” </p><p>We're happy to report that Marina not only passed her drivers test (it took 4 attempts) but also purchased her own car! Hell, yeah.</p>",
