You can use one to get rid of wrinkles, bad smells, shallow dirt and bacteria. The warmth and moisture of the steam relaxes the knit, flattening wrinkles and smoothing creases from folding. Lay your garment flat over an ironing board or another heat-resistant surface and hold the steamer or an iron about an inch above it as you surge the steam. We recommend testing a small area first. Don't allow the steamer to come in contact with the fabric or it could burn. While the fabric is warm and damp, use your hands to smooth it out and reshape to your liking. Apply more steam as you see fit and then leave to air dry. Good as new!",

But, as you might expect, pill removers should be handled carefully on a flat surface so you don't accidentally damage your new fav knit. To use one properly, gently swipe the fabric with the trimmer to remove fuzz and pilling. If you push too hard, you can damage the fabric. So try it first on a small, less noticeable spot before you go all out. Once you've finished, turn off the machine, remove the storage bin and blade protector and use a little brush to remove the fuzz around the razor blade. Make sure there are no hairs or threads left spinning around, either.",

Bonus: this can also make your knits smell great, as you can use things like blocks of aromatic cedar or lavender or cade oil. If you're storing your woolies for longer periods of time, place them in a cotton or linen storage bag (as opposed to an airtight plastic bin) so they can breathe.",

            "accordioncopy": "A steamer is your BFF when it comes to refreshing your knit and is a great way to freshen up your wool knits between seasonal washing. You can use one to get rid of wrinkles, bad smells, shallow dirt and bacteria. The warmth and moisture of the steam relaxes the knit, flattening wrinkles and smoothing creases from folding. Lay your garment flat over an ironing board or another heat-resistant surface and hold the steamer or an iron about an inch above it as you surge the steam. We recommend testing a small area first. Don't allow the steamer to come in contact with the fabric or it could burn. While the fabric is warm and damp, use your hands to smooth it out and reshape to your liking. Apply more steam as you see fit and then leave to air dry. Good as new!",

But, as you might expect, pill removers should be handled carefully on a flat surface so you don't accidentally damage your new fav knit. To use one properly, gently swipe the fabric with the trimmer to remove fuzz and pilling. If you push too hard, you can damage the fabric. So try it first on a small, less noticeable spot before you go all out. Once you've finished, turn off the machine, remove the storage bin and blade protector and use a little brush to remove the fuzz around the razor blade. Make sure there are no hairs or threads left spinning around, either.",
