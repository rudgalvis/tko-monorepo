For her, knitting isn’t just a craft—it’s pure joy. Discovering The Knotty Ones felt like finding a hidden gem, and she calls it one of the best surprises along her journey. Unlike the typical image of a knitter, Valerija doesn’t sip coffee while she knits—she finishes it first. And though she has no cats to tangle up her yarn, she manages just fine without furry assistants.",

Over the years, she's explored knitting, crocheting, and embroidery—once even running a cozy outdoor café where she baked kibinai with care. Now, at 55, Laima enjoys the calm of solo life in a new city, finding joy in contributing to The Knotty Ones. She's especially grateful to Marina for keeping her engaged with new patterns and projects. Not every design goes perfectly the first time, she says with a smile—but they always find a way forward together.",
